### Hi There, I'm Pauline Tannos (she/her/hers)! Glad to see you here. 

ðŸ˜„
I am currently looking for a full-time opportunity as either a front-end engineer or a full-stack engineer. I specialize in building full-stack applications using JavaScript (Node.js, Express, React/Redux, Sequelize, among a few others). I also know Firebase, and am currently learning Apollo GraphQL, PWAs, and TypeScript.

Ask me about anything. I am happy to chat, make new friends, and learn together.

Fun fact: My favorite animal is the octopus. They have three hearts, blue blood, and some serious problem-solving skills! My favorite animal that I can keep in my house is my Shiba Inu, Michi.
